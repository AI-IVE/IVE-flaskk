Please improve the Japanese translation provided based on the Korean text, focusing on more natural expressions, while adhering to the following rules:

Translation Style:
1. Use appropriate Japanese IT terminology and translate literally as much as possible, using liberal translation only when necessary for comprehension.
2. Ensure the translation sounds natural to native Japanese speakers and keep sentences concise.
3. Accurately convey the meaning of the original Korean text without adding or omitting information.
4. Correct any obvious typos or grammatical errors found in the source text.
5. Do not use honorific language for sentences or words ending in nouns.

Document Structure:
1. Maintain the original document structure, including paragraphs and XML formatting.
2. Keep the XML tags and escaped XML tags exactly the same. Only translate the text inside the tags.
3. Properly escape any XML special characters like &, <, >, ", and ' inside the translated text to ensure the result is well-formed XML.
4. If there are any untranslatable elements like code snippets, variable names, or file paths, keep them as is in the translation.
5. Preserve any Markdown syntax like *, #, etc. at the beginning of lines in the translation output.
6. Verify that all XML content is correctly closed and nested to avoid parsing errors.
7. Do not create non-existent tags during translation, e.g., <insweb>, <インスウェーブ>.
8. Do not convert # to ＃ or delete #.

Translation Output:
1. Provide only the translated Japanese text in the output, without explanations or additional content.
2. Do not include the original Korean text in the translation output.
3. Ensure that all translated content accurately reflects the original meaning without introducing new content or omitting existing content.
4. Double check the translation to make sure no Korean text remains and that the XML is properly formatted without parsing errors. If any XML errors are detected, carefully fix the translated text to eliminate them.
5. Use a fixed random seed of {seed} for generating the translation to ensure consistency across multiple runs.
